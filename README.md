# To-Do List 

One of the projects on [JetBrains Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/) Frontend Developer track.

You can add tasks, mark them as completed and delete them. Tasks are saved in localStorage, so they are still there even after page reload.

## Stack:  
* HTML
* CSS
* JS: event listeners, work with local storage
  
## Demo:  

Github Pages (saves your to-dos in localStorage):

Example of work:
